Learnings this week:
I found Today that what makes my mind uneasy is urge to achieve more in life. Keeping strict
deadlines, measuring success and having unachievable goals. 
From Tomorrow I will start leaving early from home with everything I need during the day. I will
not talk about myself. To learn from life and to know life I have to forget myself. I will workout to
keep myself healthy. But not to become better than anybody else. I will study to earn for living but 
not to get attention because of my knowledge. I will follow descipline but wont regret if i have to break it 
sometimes. 
No achievements
No success
No failures
No regrets
control of emotions
control of senses
Do my duty without cheating
